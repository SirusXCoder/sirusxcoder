        <p>I started with Renesas in 2011 as a Sr Business Intelligence consultant responsible for building out a new
          Sales Reps reporting system. The requirements of the system were such that Sales Reps could login to the
          system and see *only* their unique sales data based on custom geography. The second main feature is that they
          have the ability to extend their own reports with custom subject areas. In addition, built several data cubes
          (star schema) to assist in multi-dimensional reporting using Birst.</p>
